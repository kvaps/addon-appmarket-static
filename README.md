## Driver Installation

Driver installation:

```
git clone https://github.com/kvaps/opennebula-static-marketplace
cp -r opennebula-static-marketplace/driver/static /var/lib/one/remotes/market/
```

Update `/etc/one/oned.conf`:

Add `static` into `MARKET_MAD` argumets:

```
MARKET_MAD = [
    EXECUTABLE = "one_market",
    ARGUMENTS  = "-t 15 -m http,s3,one,static"
]
```

After that create a new `TM_MAD_CONF` section:

```
MARKET_MAD_CONF = [
    NAME = "static",
    SUNSTONE_NAME  = "Statically Generated Marketplace",
    REQUIRED_ATTRS = "",
    APP_ACTIONS = "monitor",
    PUBLIC = "yes"
]
```

## Driver configuration

The following attributes can be used for configure marketplace

|    Attribute        |                     Description                |
